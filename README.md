# Arithmetic Game
Simple command-line game for practising mental arithmetic.

## Downloading and Running the Game
Currently only binaries for Windows are given.  
To get this working on macOS or Linux, you could compile from source using Mono, for example, but note that I've only tested this with .NET C#.

1.  Download `ArithmeticGame.exe` and `Ruben9922.Utilities.ConsoleUtilities.dll` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Ruben9922/arithmetic-game/releases).
2.  Ensure the files are in the same folder. (The program will not work if the required `.dll` file is not in the same folder.)
3.  Run `ArithmeticGame.exe`.
